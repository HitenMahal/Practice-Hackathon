The program created is a Parking Lot Simulator:
"The target simulator is supposed to demonstrate cars randomly entering the
parking lot and staying there for a period, and then leaving the lot randomly. The exact time that a car
enters the lot, and the time that it leaves the lot are recorded. Based on these two times the simulator
should display the duration of stay for each car at the exit gate"
